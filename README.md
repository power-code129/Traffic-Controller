# Traffic-Controller
## AIM: 
To design and implement a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog HDL that handles vehicle and pedestrian signals for North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions. The controller also includes a night mode and vehicle sensor input to optimize traffic flow based on real-time road conditions 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED: 
1. Microsoft Visual Studio Code 
2. Icarus Verilog 
3. Gtkwave (simulation) 
4. PC 
## THEORY: 
The Traffic Light Controller is designed as a finite state machine (FSM) implemented in Verilog, managing traffic flow at a two-way intersection comprising North-South and East-West directions. This intelligent controller handles both vehicular presence and pedestrian crossing requests to ensure safe and efficient traffic management. The FSM operates through various states, including Green, Yellow, and Red for each direction, along with a special Blink state activated during night mode. Key inputs to the system include clk (system clock), rst (reset signal), night_mode (to activate blinking yellow lights during low traffic hours), sensor_NS and sensor_EW (which detect vehicles waiting in the respective directions), and ped_NS and ped_EW (pedestrian request buttons for crossing). The outputs generated by the controller are light_NS and light_EW, which are 3-bit signals representing the current traffic light status (Green, Yellow, or Red) for each direction, and ped_signal_NS and ped_signal_EW, which indicate when pedestrians are allowed to cross. The FSM transitions between states based on pre-defined timing parameters, ensuring that each light remains active (Green, Yellow, or Red) for a specified duration. These transitions are dynamically influenced by real-time inputs from vehicle sensors and pedestrian requests. In night mode, to conserve power and reduce unnecessary delays, both traffic directions enter a blinking yellow state, allowing vehicles to proceed cautiously while maintaining basic traffic control.
